          i have spent the last few years working on everything from 
          <span className="font-semibold"> sports analytics platforms </span>, 
          banking systems and tax solutions. i have learned that the best code 
          is the kind that solves real problems for people. currently, i'm 
          working on <span className="font-semibold"> cloud-based tools </span> 
          that help professionals get their work done faster and with less hassle.

          before that, i was in the finance world building systems to catch bad 
          actors and keep money safe. i also worked on some cool 
          <span className="font-semibold"> sports tech </span> stuff where we 
          tracked everything from player performance to game analytics. 
          what i love most about coding is that moment when 
          <span className="font-semibold"> everything clicks </span> and you 
          realize you've built something that actually makes someone's life a 
          little bit easier.

          in free time, i like to play guitar and read books. gaming is my 
          second favorite thing to do, so ps5 is my go-to. spending my time 
          with pet dogs always brings me joy and refreshes my soul, 
          i usually top it off with some anime music that bring 
          <span className="font-semibold"> peace to my mind </span>.
